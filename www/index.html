        Some notes:
            * gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and is needed for JS->native communication
            * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
            * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
                * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src

                                Correctly the Fun Way!</b></h4> 
    <p>Why should you learn how to speak with irregular past tense perfectly?
Because the irregular verbs are used more when we speak. 70% of the
time we speak we are using irregular past tense verbs. But when we write,
we use many more verbs and these verbs are regular. Can you believe it? ￼
70% of the time we speak in past tense we are using irregular past tense
verbs! Regular verbs have –ed ends like talk-talked. We use regular past
only 30% of the time when we speak.
The ten most used verbs are irregular. (be, have, do, say, make, go, take,
come, see, get). They are all irregular. </p>
